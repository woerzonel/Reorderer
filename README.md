# Reorder Mod
## By NoLongerLloyd
This mod on level up acts the like the order shrine with a few changes. It can randomize even if you haven't gotten a new item. It also randomises based on all items of that tier (doesn't do boss items). For fun I added a 1-3 roll for how many random items in that tier it will give you.
(still a few bugs, its my first mod).


## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx Mod Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/)
2. Install [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/)
3. Download the latest reorderer.dll here.
4. Move reorderer.dll to your \BepInEx\plugins folder



## Known Bugs
- Sometimes creats a stack of 1 or 2 items that it shouldn't have.
- Somtimes for red items it will create like 6 random items when max should be 3.

##Planned Updates
- IConsidering adding or adding the option to do both boss randomization and equipment.

## Changelog
